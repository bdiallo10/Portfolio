    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name is Boubacar Diallo. Currently, I am now an alumni of Gonzaga
      University School of Professional Studies. I majored in
      Communication and Leadership studies while working fulltime
      for call centers. I started as a customer service representative
      at Conduent, then I was promoted to workforce management and after
      the closured of the center I move to Blue Nile doing more Customer
       service. My passion is helping people. I enjoy learning, problem
       solving, activism, and volunteering for non-profit organization.
       My long-term goals are furthering my education in leadership and
       management, opening a consulting business in management and leadership,
       investment and research. </p>
    <h1> Communication and Leadership Philosophy</h1>
    <p>My philosophy is that communication and leadership is
      the most vital tools in our world. Without communication
      and leadership, all types of issues will arises within
      families, communities, friends, businesses and nations.
      However, when communication and leadership have genuine
      compassion, understanding, and respect, our world will be a f
      ar better place to live. My philosophy is suited for individuals
      and organizations that is interested creating a culture of
      genuine compassion, respect, and understanding. </p>
